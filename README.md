# TRACKING LOCATION AND NETWORK PROVIDER FROM NUMBER

Python is the king of automation. It does a lot of things you could think of â€” WhatsApp  message automation, email automation, web scraping, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptocurrency, web development, and a lot more. In this project, we will be giving a random phone number of  any country from around the world. We  have to find out the location/country of the  given number	while also finding out	the  network provider of the number.
